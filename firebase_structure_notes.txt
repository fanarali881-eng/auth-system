Firebase Structure from Screenshot:

verification.current
  - attemptNumber: 1
  - timestamp: "2025-12-15T21:54:51.773Z"
  - verificationCode: "443333"

verification.verification_status: "approved"

The structure shows:
- verification is a nested object
- verification.current contains the current attempt data
- verification.verification_status is at the same level as verification.current

This matches what the code expects!
